# EbolaRiskMap
This project is based on creating a risk map for Ebola. Ebola is an extremely dangerous virus and knowing where it resides prominently is extremely important. This data is gathered from the locations of bats infected with Ebola, since there is a direct correlation between bats and Ebola outbreak zones.
